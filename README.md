# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2020.  The current goal is to try to do them all in C.  If I have to fall back on Rust or Python, I'll do that.

## Running the Code

I'm using `make`.  To run everything, run:

```shell
make run
```

To run the tests:

```
make test
```
